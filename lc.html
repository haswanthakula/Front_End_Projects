                <h2>A Bumpy Ride</h2>
                <p>My sister and I embarked on a seemingly innocent journey to our grandmother's house on our bicycles. The ride was filled with laughter and carefree abandon until disaster struck. A sudden fall left my sister shaken and with a newfound fear of bicycles. From that day forward, the once-trusted two-wheeler became a forbidden mode of transport for her.

                <h2>The Endless Summer</h2>
                <p>The summer of the state division was a unique and extended period of my childhood. A prolonged ‘canthra bandh’ (strike) brought schools to a standstill for nearly two months. While I was blissfully unaware of the political turmoil, the unexpected break transformed my world. Days stretched into weeks, filled with endless play, exploration, and the freedom of a carefree childhood. It was a summer that blurred the lines between morning, evening, and night, leaving an imprint of joy and innocence that I cherish to this day.

                <h2>The Storm at Home</h2>
                <p>One of the most vivid memories from my late childhood involves a particularly long night. I was around nine or ten when I attended a friend's birthday party. Lost in the fun, I didn't realize how late it had gotten until it was almost midnight. Returning home, I was met with a furious father. The scolding that followed felt like a storm, and I spent the entire night crying, feeling like the biggest disappointment.

                <h2>A Flickering Memory</h2>
                <p>One of my earliest cinematic memories is watching "Jai Chiranjeeva" starring the legendary Chiranjeevi when I was just three years old. Though I can barely remember the details, the magic of the big screen and the vibrant colors must have left a lasting impression on my tiny mind.

                <h2>Early Mishaps</h2>
                <p>My earliest memories are filled with a curious blend of bravery and luck. Mom often tells tales of my toddler years. I apparently took a tumble down the stairs more than once, and there was also that time I decided to explore the depths of a hot milk mug. Miraculously, I escaped these adventures unscathed, leaving my parents both relieved and bewildered.

                <h2>Tirupati Tapestry</h2>
                <p>My earliest memory of Tirupati is a hazy, dreamlike journey undertaken shortly after my birth. Carried in the arms of loved ones, I embarked on a sacred pilgrimage to the abode of Lord Venkateswara. Though I have no conscious recollection of the experience, the significance of this journey has been deeply ingrained in my life. It is a chapter that connects me to my family's spiritual heritage and marks the beginning of my own journey.
